 * - If the user wants to bridge ETH and the receiver is a contract, the bridge will send WETH
 * - If the user wants to bridge WETH and the receiver is an EOA, the bridge will send ETH
 * @param destinationChainId Destination chain id.

 * @param isReceiverContract Whether the receiver is a contract or not.
